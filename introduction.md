## Introduction

No code is self-explanatory. It’s a tool we design, or, more often, a complex organism that develops as we use it, such as a library of functions used within a research team to perform certain kinds of analysis.

## Why document software?

It’s a common occurrence to get a software package, whether it’s written by ourselves, a colleague, or someone else, that’s near-impossible to use because it’s unclear what each function or tool does. Maybe we look at the source code itself, but we can’t make head-nor-tail of it. Maybe the only person who can use this software is the person who wrote it—unless you wrote it and forgot what you were thinking when you did!

### Advantages of good documentation

There are many advantages to writing guidance to go along with your research software. Software documentation helps yourself and others to use it successfully in the future and read your code ensuring that its value is sustained.

It helps with your software engineering practice to reflect on what the purpose of the software is and to articulate what each component or module is for.

Research outputs often depend upon the code used to generate them. Clarity and confidence are essential in using code to perform calculations, simulations, or data analysis. All kinds of research software  can be made more reproducible by providing clear context and instructions for using it.

There are many advantages to making your code more readable. Well-documented software is easier to maintain and has greater sustainability, which means it can continue to be used and modified for a longer period of time, despite changes in technology. If software is more reusable then it encourages others to use it for their research, increasing the number of citations of that software and its overall research impact.

Writing a useful software package that is well-documented and can be reused in the future means that your code could take on a life of its own, with benefits that extend beyond yourself to your collaborators and other researchers in the future.
