# Research Software Documentation

This repository contains a [training module on documenting research software](https://fair2-for-research-software.github.io/Documentation/) that is part of the [training provision for research computing](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/) at the University of Sheffield and developed as part of the [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for research software](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/)Â course.

## Course description

This course will introduce you to the different ways we can provide guidance to future users and maintainers of our code. These coding best practices range from the very simple, such as leaving a few handy notes, to the complex, generating a reference website that includes tutorials and a detailed reference. The right approach for your projects will probably be a blend of these, and depends on the context and your audience.
