---

## Sample code

There is an example project contained in a code repository that is hosted on GitHub at
[Joe-Heffer-Shef/oddsong](https://github.com/Joe-Heffer-Shef/oddsong).  As we proceed through the course, we'll create a
collection of scripts similar to this.  Please feel free to refer to this example to help you engage with the course
contents.

## Software Setup

This course may be completed using *either* the Python programming language **or** the R statistical package.  Please
use the tool that you prefer.

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
well. We will be using some of the inbuilt functionality of Python 3.

The [R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/) is a statistical package that is designed for data exploration,
visualization, and data analysis. To interact with R, the most popular tool is [RStudio
Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
