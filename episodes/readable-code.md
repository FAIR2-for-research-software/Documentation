It’s a common trope in the software engineering world that code is read much more often than it is written. It’s important that our code is approachable for new people to use with confidence, as they might want to review the code itself to understand what it does. Also, when you maintain your code, or come back to it in the future, you’ll be grateful for the effort you made in making it easy to interpret and follow its logic.
