## Collaborative research software development

Often, in today's research environment, much analytics software is written in a **collaborative manner**, involving multiple specialists from within a team, or from multiple institutions. For the long-term health of a software package, it’s important to encourage potential contributors to get in touch and feel welcome to take part. Useful research software can take on a life of its own.

## Research software project management

For more information on planning the development of research software and project governance, see Module 1a.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

It’s often published using an open source licence, which means that all the code is publicly available and may be used and modified by anyone, within certain conditions (see module 1b to learn more about software licensing.)

There's a lot more to creating and managing a sustainable community around a research software project, but having a central piece of documentation for contributors is a great start!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Consider these questions amongst the group:

- How can we effectively foster a collaborative environment for research software development?
- How can barriers to participation be removed for a diverse range of individuals and institutions?
- What strategies can be implemented to ensure that all contributors feel valued and included?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Contribution guides

Contribution guidelines help users and understand how they can **help to improve the software**, whether that’s by submitting bug reports, suggesting new features, or writing better code and documentation. All of these aspects are vital to produce reusable research software.

Potential collaborators should be able to easily find out how to take part and contribute. Developers should be encouraged to use **appropriate communication channels** to ask questions and inform others of proposed software changes. The contact details for the project administrator or committee should be available and they should be welcome and responsive to any queries.

It’s important to explain how the project is managed so the process for evaluating new features and getting them implemented is clear, such as the code review and approval process. For many projects, a **ticket system** may be used to raise issues and suggest new features. Software developers often propose new code by creating a branch on the version control system (such as Git) and requesting for those changes to be merged into the main codebase.

Contribution guides will save you time in the long run, because it provides an on-ramp for people to get involved, prevents them from getting confused, and reduces the amount of incorrectly-submitted bug reports or requests for change, etc.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Discuss these issues amongst the group:

- What essential components should be included in a comprehensive documentation for research software contributors?
- How can we make onboarding new contributors a smooth and welcoming process, ensuring they have the necessary information and support to be successful?
- How can we balance the need for clear guidelines with the desire to encourage creativity and innovation?

### How to write contributor guidance

The standard practice for authoring a contribution guide for a software project is to create a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root folder of your project. This is a Markdown file that introduces new people to the project. It lets people know the ways they can take part in the research software project and what to do to get involved.

The specific contents of this file depend upon the kind of research project, but some useful information to provide typically includes:

- An introduction to the organisation and **structure of the code**, possibly including diagrams.
- Instructions to **raising issues**, suggesting new features, and proposing code changes.
- Links to **additional documentation** that's hosted elsewhere, such as a code of conduct or discussion forum.
- A walkthrough to setting up a development environment, such as guidance on installing developer tools or other prerequisites.

On code repository hosting platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com), the [contribution guide](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) will be created automatically using this `CONTRIBUTING.md` Markdown file.

:::: challenge

Create a new file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` and populate it with a few sentences.

- What are the most important things for a new contributor to know?
- What should a user do if they encounter a bug?
- What are the common questions that a new developer might have when they work on this research software?

## Software project governance

Project governance defines the **scope and aims** of a research software engineering project, and determines how decisions will be made and carried out. It sets out the **processes and responsibilities** that collaborators must understand to take part. This is something that should be considered when preparing a software management plan, as discussed in Module 1a of this course. This is important to make sure that questions of who does what, and how, are stated clearly so that everyone can understand and collaborate effectively to produce excellent research software. It's worthwhile to think about this early on in a project to avoid potential pitfalls later on!

### Code of conduct

A code of conduct provides **guidelines for the expected behaviour** of people who are involved in the project. You may want to provide some general tips to create a productive community of researchers around the software, such as creating positive interactions between contributors, treat others with respect and dignity, and recommendations for processes for handling differences of opinion.

This has the following advantages:

- Fosters a healthy, **collaborative working environment** where people feel respected, included, and can freely share ideas.
- **Managing expectations** and creating clear rules will reduce the amount of time wasted due to misunderstanding and conflicts.
- **Build a communinity**: an ethically-run and transparent project will encourage contributors to share the values of the project and remain engaged.

For many working in a research context, there are additional considerations to ensure that institutional policies, ethics, and data protection regulations are carefully observed. These protocols are outside the scope of this document, but these factors should be clearly communicated to all contributors.

### Contributor Covenant

Many open-source research software projects adopt the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which is a template charter that may be customised to suit the needs of your collaborators.

::::

## Developer notes

For people who are contributing code to the project, they'll need the following information:

- Which version control system is being used. Typically, this will be `git` or similar tools, as discussed in Module 2 of this course.
- How to add automatic tests and whether a testing framework is in place.
- Describe the code organisation and package structure.

### Technical documentation

System documentation is important for new contributors to **familiarise themselves with the codebase** and as a reference for existing engineers. There should be a concise description of how the system works from a more technical perspective, with the intended audience being software developers, rather than the research users.

An **architecture diagram** is an efficient way to provide a “map” to help developers to understand and navigate a complex system.

### Coding conventions

Many projects follow a set of programming standards to **manage code quality**. A coding style guide will help to ensure consistency across all the code written as part of a collaborative project, which helps others to read and interpret the code, making it easier to maintain in the long run. The code style rules should cover things like the way to describe functions, how to indent code, and naming conventions for variables.

This might include guidance and advice, or more strict rules as standards that are checked by a **code linter**. A code linter is an analysis tool that inspects code and checks for common errors and problems, producing a report for the developer to read and act upon. Common coding style standards include the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for the Python programming language and the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) in the R statistical language.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Discuss these issues as a group:

- Why are coding conventions important for collaborative research projects?
- How can we establish and enforce coding style guidelines that promote consistency and readability?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- **Encourage collaboration:** There are **many ways to contribute** to a research software project, including bug reoprts, feature suggests, design discussions, documentation, and software engineering.
- **Clear processes:** Explain the process for making changes and having them included into the code
- **Bug reports:** Create simple ways for users to report issues and have these problems resolved in a timely manner.
- **Communication:** Create appropriate communication channels so that design discussions and proposed changes may be worked through transparently.
