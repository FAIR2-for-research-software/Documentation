## Sample code

There is an example project contained in a code repository that is hosted on GitHub at [Joe-Heffer-Shef/oddsong](https://github.com/Joe-Heffer-Shef/oddsong).
As we proceed through the course, we'll create a collection of scripts similar to this.
Please feel free to refer to this example to help you engage with the course contents.

## Software Setup

This course may be completed using *either* the Python programming language **or** the R statistical package.
Please use the tool that you prefer.

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose
programming as well. We will be using some of the inbuilt functionality of Python 3.

The [R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/) is a statistical package that is designed for data exploration, visualization,
and data analysis. To interact with R, the most popular tool is
[RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

#### Python

There is a guide for [using Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) in the
Python documentation. [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) are
