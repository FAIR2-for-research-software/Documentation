## Software Setup

This course may be completed using *either* the Python programming language **or** the R statistical package.
Please use the tool that you prefer.

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose
programming as well. We will be using some of the inbuilt functionality of Python 3.

The [R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/) is a statistical package that is designed for data exploration, visualization,
and data analysis. To interact with R, the most popular tool is
[RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
