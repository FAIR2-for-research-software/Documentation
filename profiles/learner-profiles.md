## Target audience

This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate research students, who write software (whether a few scripts or something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to follow best practices to make their code and data more reproducible.

This course is intended for researchers who use either of the programming languages Python or R, but no expert knowledge of these is required.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites
This module assumes no prior knowledge of software documentation. However, some familiarity with the fundamental concepts of programming languages is necessary. Some of these concepts include:

- Basic **syntax**;
- Using **functions** for procedural programming;
- Storing data in **variables**.

Most of the content is relevant to any programming language, but the practical examples will use Python and R. For the sections on generating documentation pages, a basic knowledge of version control using Git and GitHub will be advantageous.
