## Target audience

This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate research students, who write software (whether a few scripts
or something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to follow best practices to make their code and
data more reproducible.

This course is intended for researchers who use either of the programming languages Python or R, but no expert knowledge
of these is required.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites This module assumes no prior knowledge of software documentation. However, some familiarity with the
fundamental concepts of programming languages is necessary. Some of these concepts include:

- Basic **syntax**;
- Using **functions** for procedural programming;
- Storing data in **variables**.

Most of the content is relevant to any programming language, but the practical examples will use Python and R. For the
sections on generating documentation pages, a basic knowledge of version control using Git and GitHub will be
advantageous.
